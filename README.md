# NoOneSurvivedTranslations
This repository contains .po  files, with text of the game.

## Instructions
1) You should create an account on GitHub.
2) Access your language file and open the Game.po file.
3) You just will need to change the text in **msgstr** line. <br /> **Never forget** the **" "** between the text.
4) When you finish, make a pull-request (PR).
5) if everything is correct, it'll be merged.

## Warning
It is not recommended to use Poedit anymore. It is automatically performing some changes to the code lines 
and this can lead to many problems over time.

**The filename and extension (Game.po) can't be changed.**
