# NoOneSurvivedTranslations
This repository contains .po  files, with text of the game.

## Instructions
1) You should create an account on GitHub.
2) Access your language folder and open the Game.po file.
3) You just will need to change the text in **msgstr** line. <br /> **Never forget** the **" "** between the text.
4) When you finish, make a **pull-request**.
5) if everything is correct, it'll be merged in main file.

## Warning
It is not recommended to use Poedit anymore. It is automatically performing some changes to the code lines 
and this can lead to many problems over time.

**The filename and extension (Game.po) can't be changed.**

## Credits
Anyone is welcome to translate these files since the respective language team is not full. 
Your willingness to help us is very appreciated and your name will be in the Translation Support section.
